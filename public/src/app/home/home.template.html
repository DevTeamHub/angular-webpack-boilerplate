            <h2>We prepared some effective solutions to simplify your work</h2>
            <p>
                Build features quickly with simple, declarative templates.
                Extend the template language with your own components and use a wide array of existing components.
                Get immediate Angular-specific help and feedback with nearly every IDE and editor.
                All this comes together so you can focus on building amazing apps rather than trying to make the code
                work.
